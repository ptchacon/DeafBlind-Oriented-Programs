# DeafBlind-Oriented-Programs
In general, develop programs that are oriented toward Braille display users.

I use wxPython GUI package and NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) screen reader as the basis of programs developed here. I aim to develop tools that are intuitive to 
read and respond on Braille display.

Nothing fancy in the early stages of this process...
